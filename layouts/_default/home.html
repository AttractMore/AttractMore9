        <p>I would highly recommend Roger. Roger initially created for us a simple yet attractive e-commerce website which worked perfectly and fit our budgets. As our business has grown, Roger has been instrumental in developing our website.</p>
        <p>Roger also prepared a detailed report on how we could improve SEO for our website. The result has been a significant increase in our organic web traffic. Roger also responds to our requests really quickly which I really appreciate - it helps me feel that we are truly supported and protected from an IT point of view.</p>

        <h3>Renée Watson @ Curiosity Box</h3>
        <p>It was with some trepidation that I first came to Roger with the challenge of recreating a more efficient and effective website. I needed a site that enabled us to improve sales conversions, whilst capturing our brand and values in a way that our current website did not. I had been through a number of fairly disastrous web development experiences and I was very anxious about spending a lot of money to only fail again.</p>
        <p>I needn’t have worried! Roger has delivered far better than I expected. He is able to communicate and translate the more technical aspects of the website, whilst completely understanding what we are trying to achieve from a customer perspective. In my experience, this is an <strong>incredibly rare combination</strong>, and it really sets Roger apart.</p>
        <p>Not only that, Roger has worked out as an incredibly cost effective solution and I really wish we had have skipped the agencies and come to him first. Even though he's a freelancer, Roger feels like <strong>a hugely valuable part of our team</strong> now. He brings a breadth of skills that make him like a one man tech department which, as a small business, is something that usually feels out of reach.</p>

    <p class="intro centre">We support the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" rel="noopener, noreferrer">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> and actively work towards making an impact on four key goals:</p>
    <ul class="sdg-images">
      <li><img src="/images/sdgs/un-sdg-goal-10.webp" alt="UN SDG Goal 10 - Reduced Inequalities" width="300" height="300" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></li>

    </ul>
    <article class="text-block">
      <h3>10 Reduced Inequalities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Many parts of the world have much slower internet connections than we do in the UK. Our sustainable, highly efficient websites transfer less data over the internet which means greater access to these websites globally.</li>
        <li>A significant percentage of people with access to the internet have slower, less powerful devices. Our websites make less demand on devices making them more accessible to a larger number of people across the globe.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>12 Responsible Consumption and Production</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Low-carbon websites are much more efficient than the average site, which means they consume less electricity (and therefore less fossil fuels).</li>
        <li>We aim to use “green” hosting companies that power their servers using renewable energy sources only.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>13 Climate Action</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We build websites using tools and techniques that keep their carbon footprint as low as possible.</li>
        <li>Our website is cleaner than 94% of websites tested by <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/" rel="noopener, noreferrer,  nofollow">Wholegrain Digital</a>.</li>
        <li>Our website is Climate Positive, accredited by the <a href="https://ecofriendlyweb.org/" rel="noopener, noreferrer, nofollow">Eco-friendly Web Alliance</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>17 Partnerships for the Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We work with businesses that want to reduce their carbon footprint.</li>
        <li>We work in partnership with designers, marekters and content creators that are also aligned with the UN SDGs.</li>
