summaryText: "<p>Before starting the design of your website, we carry out <strong>thorough research</strong> to understand your business and audience needs. We analyse your objectives, explore competitor websites, and understand your target audience's motivations and concerns. This insight guides us in creating content and designs tailored to convert visitors into customers.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge we can move quickly into detailed design of your new website. We will always ensure that the designs are <strong>mobile friendly</strong> and that they will adapt smoothly to display well on screens of all sizes. Design also considers potential <strong>carbon emissions</strong> and <strong>performance</strong>.</p>
<p>Post-development, we rigorously test your website to ensure it will work on any device. We also <strong>check carbon emissions</strong> and <strong>test page load speed</strong>, fine tuning for lowest emissions and best performance. We provide a seamless migration plan to preserve the value of your previous site and avoid 'page not found' errors.</p>"
