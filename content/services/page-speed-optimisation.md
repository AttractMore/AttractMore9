Slow loading web pages give a poor impression of your business to site visitors. If their first contact with your brand is a frustrating one, it is unlikely that they will want to engage with you. A study by Google showed that, if a page takes over 3 seconds to load, over 50% of visitors will leave before it completes.

In addition, Google downgrades slow loading pages in the search results which may well lead to you receiving less traffic than otherwise.

The good news is that we can **speed up your web pages** using a variety of techniques and we offer a low-cost assessment of your site speed. As well as improving the visitor experience and a potential improvement in your search engine rankings, **faster websites use less power and so have a reduced carbon footprint**.
