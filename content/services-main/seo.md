Ensuring **site visibility** in Google, Bing and other search engines is a priority for organisations. These days, search engine optimisation is far more than just matching keywords and acquiring incoming links. Many more factors have a significant bearing on where your site will be positioned in the search results for a given phrase.

If you would like to **improve the SEO** of your existing website, we can examine your site and make recommendations for improvement. These suggestions will cover ‘on page’ factors such as the content and technical elements as well as ‘off page’ aspects such as links and social media.

SEO is not a one-off exercise, it requires **monitoring** so that changes to search algorithms and the improvement of competitor sites are recognised and appropriate, timely action is taken.
