**AttractMore is delighted to announce that it has joined many other companies in signing up to the Good Business Charter (GBC), an accreditation that seeks to raise the bar on business practices for employees, tax, the environment, customers and suppliers.**

The Charter is an initiative developed and overseen by the Good Business Foundation, an independent charity established by entrepreneur Julian Richer. Working with organisations including the TUC, IoD and FSB, they have set a benchmark for responsible business practice, which is accessible to all.

We are proud to be accredited by the Good Business Charter and are keen to share our commitment to ethical business practice with you. The GBC consists of 10 components and more details for each of these components can be found on [their website](https://goodbusinesscharter.com/). As an organisation with under 51 employees:

1. We commit to pay our directly employed and regularly contracted staff the real living wage as defined by the Living Wage Foundation.
2. We commit to only use zero or minimal hours contracts when it is mutually beneficial and accepted by both us and the employee.
3. We will actively support and encourage employee well-being treating those with legitimate sickness in a fair and respectful manner and promote access to impartial support and advice for employees with physical and mental health needs.
4. We commit to having a way where every employee can make suggestions or raise issues with senior management.
5. We commit to have robust measures in place to encourage diversity at key stages of recruitment, selection and retention of employees and to prevent harassment or victimisation in the workplace.
6. We care about the environment and encourage the development of good environmental practice as an organisation, seeking to minimise our impact and commit to improve it.
7. We commit to pay our taxes where applicable, only use tax allowances for the purpose intended, and be transparent in our relationship with HMRC.
8. We have a clear commitment to our stakeholders and prioritise addressing and learning from stakeholder feedback, seeking to put negative issues right.
9. We commit to ethical sourcing of anything we purchase, such as by applying standards set out in the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code where relevant.
10. We commit to paying our suppliers promptly, and within at least 30 days.

The Good Business Charter exists for all UK companies, charities and public sector organisations across all industries and sectors and works through a simple online self-certification process.  At a time when people are caring more about who they work for and who they buy from, the GBC offers a straightforward accreditation, recognising organisations that prioritise and value their employees, customers, suppliers and the environment, whilst also paying their taxes according to the spirit of the law.

It has never been more important for businesses to build trust and show that they care about more than just profit. Therefore, the GBC and its members seek to inspire many other businesses to follow suit.
