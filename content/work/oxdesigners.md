text: "Ox Designers is a graphic design agency specialising in STEM clients. The previous version of their website wasn't focussed on STEM companies, so the purpose of the redesign was to make the target audience clear. In addition, there were a number of technical issues that were of concern, so the project included a new WordPress theme, better SEO and speeding up the load time of the web pages. A blog is also included."

The purpose of this redesign and rebuild was two-fold.

Firstly, Emma of Ox Designers, wanted the site to focus more on her primary target audience of STEM companies. Secondly, the WordPress theme had not been updated in a while and the plugins it depended on could not be updated. This was a security risk and lead to a loss of confidence in the theme and its future so it needed to be replaced.

Emma designed the site, wrote additional content and decided to include a blog on the website and wrote a number of posts.

Our job was

- to provide advice on web design (in particular for smaller screen devices)
- select a WordPress theme which would, as far as possible, be future-proof
- migrate existing content
- rebuild the site in the best technical way, taking careful account of SEO factors throughout.

As always, we carried out a thorough testing phase, carefully managing issues we uncovered, correcting these and retesting.

Following completion of the testing phase, we moved the new site live. We then went through the post-implementation checklist covering appearance, function and performance. There were no issues and we were satisfied that pages loaded in less than 3 seconds on a reasonable connection with most pages loading in around 1 second.

Another successful project outcome.
