This project was another productive and enjoyable collaboration with Nikki Shield from [Designs Like These](https://designslikethese.co.uk/). Nikki carried out the discovery and design phases, and we built, tested and implemented it.

The earlier Wickenstones website had been based on WordPress, so it made sense to continue with this platform. AttractMore created a WordPress theme specifically for this site to match the design developed by Nikki.

As with all of our projects, we went through a [rigorous testing phase](/services/website-creation/web-development-website-testing/), checking page load speeds, appearance and functionality across a large number of browsers, operating systems and devices. Older versions of these were included in our tests so we could be confident that the site would look good and work properly on the vast majority of devices currently in use, mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop.

We also measured the carbon emissions of all the pages to ensure that the site was as low carbon as possible. The pages are all cleaner than 90% of all web pages globally which is a considerable improvement over the previous site.
