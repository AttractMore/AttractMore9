  background: "The business had an old website that they had built themselves many years ago and this didn’t work on smaller devices and it certainly did not reflect the quality of the service offered. We were asked to design a new site that was fast, modern and secure that would show the business in the best way and be found easily for relevant phrases in the search engines."
  outcome: "The business now has a site they can be proud of which is fast, modern, secure that presents them in a much more favourable light than before. The client is able to update the content as they wish, simply and quickly."
testimonial:
  p1: "Roger really helped me to establish my business branding and developed a fresh new website. As a relatively new business I had little content to work with and encouraged a different approach to overcome this. Roger <strong>developed a fantastic new site within a fixed budget</strong>, taking on all the technical migration aspects from my old to new site."

Before we started on the design, we spent some time understanding the business and its target customers to appreciate what the customers needed, their concerns and the outcomes they wanted. We also examined competitor websites in some detail to see how they addressed the customer needs. This aspect of our work leads to more successful websites and is an important part of our [process](/services/website-creation/understanding-your-business/).

We designed a new website based on the information discovered. We also wrote most of the content for the site taking account of what was on the existing site and how other companies presented their information.

We then built the new site and tested it on a wide variety of browsers, operating systems and devices to give full confidence that the site would work well no matter what device a visitor chose to use.

The site was implemented on a new secure, server in such a way that links to the old pages seamlessly redirected to the most relevant new ones.

There is a Content Management System in place for the client to edit the content, add images and write new blog posts.

The client’s email was also migrated to a new, more secure server as they had been receiving a great deal of spam email.
