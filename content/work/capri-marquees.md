  background: "Capri Marquees are a well-established marquee hire business. They are based in Oxfordshire but operate across the Midlands and South of the UK. Their previous website was functional but old-fashioned and it did not display properly on mobiles or tablets. It was also somewhat slow to load. They felt that they were losing out to competitors and so commissioned a new website."
  outcome: "Capri Marquees now have a modern website that works properly on mobiles and tablets and loads quickly whatever device is used. As of the date of writing, site visitors are up 18% and page views are up 10% compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. Visitors arriving via the search engines account for 74% of all visitors (compared to only 54% in the same period in the previous year)."

Again, this was a collaboration with Nikki from [Designs Like These](https://designslikethese.co.uk). Nikki designed the site in conjunction with the management team at Capri and we built, tested and implemented the site.

There is no Content Management System on this site as there will be few updates. Any that are needed will be covered in the ongoing maintenance and support contract that Capri have with ourselves. The site was coded in HTML, CSS and Javascript and one important advantage of this approach is that it reduces the exposure and vulnerability of the site to attack by hackers.

The site includes information about the marquees that can be hired but also about the range of accessories that are on offer with marquee hire. Prices, FAQs and a detailed marquee planner are also available.

As with all of our projects, we went through a comprehensive testing process, checking page load speeds, appearance and functionality across a wide range of browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge etc.), operating systems (Windows, Android, OSX, iOS) and devices (desktops, mobiles and tablets). Older versions of all these were included in our tests so we could be confident that the site looked good and worked properly on the vast majority of devices currently in use.
