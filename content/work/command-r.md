  background: "The previous website for Command-R was fairly basic and the owner, Rolf Woodward, commissioned Nikki and myself to design and build a new site. The new site had to present the services that Command-R offered and do so in a way that reflected Rolf's character and interests outside work."
  outcome: "Command-R now have a super-fast, modern website that reflects the character and professionalism of the company and the range of services offered."

This project was another excellent collaboration with Nikki Shield from [Designs Like These](https://designslikethese.co.uk/).

The design that Nikki developed involved a number of horizontal and vertical lines with rounded ends. The lines also had a gradient colour and this was an interesting technical challenge that we were able to successfully overcome so that it worked in all modern (and not-so-modern) browsers.

The technical implementation was not WordPress in this case. Rolf was keen to have a very low carbon website, so the platform we chose was HUGO. We added a Content Management System speifically for this site (based on DeCap) and it all worked very smoothly.

Because of the nature of the work Command-R do, the content was, inevitably rather technical. We decied to invest in the copywriting services of [Jenny Haken](https://www.jennyhaken.co.uk/) who was able to make the copy accessible and readable while emphasising the benefits of each service.

As with all of our projects, we went through a [rigorous testing phase](/services/website-creation/web-development-website-testing/), checking page load speeds, appearance and functionality across a large number of browsers, operating systems and devices. Older versions of these were included in our tests so we could be confident that the site would look good and work properly on the vast majority of devices currently in use, mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop.

We also measured the carbon emissions of all the pages to ensure that the site was as low carbon as possible. The pages are all cleaner than 95% of all web pages globally.
