  background: "MB HR Support, run by Mandy Brearley, is a well-known HR company working with small and medium-sized businesses in Oxfordshire and surrounding counties. Her previous website was old-fashioned and was not mobile friendly. It had also been hacked and had a number of unwanted links peppered around the site, pointing to very dubious sites. The project was to create a new site that was modern, clear, responsive and, of course, as secure as possible."
  outcome: "MB HR Support now have a professional website that works across all device sizes and types and which Mandy can update."

This project was the result of yet another collaboration with Nikki from [Designs Like These](https://www.designslikethese.co.uk/). Nikki designed the site and we built, tested and implemented it. This site is based on WordPress as was the previous MB HR Support website. This allowed us to easily transfer over the blog posts that Mandy wanted to keep from the old site to the new one. The new site has a theme that was built from scratch for this project making it unique to MB HR Support.

As with every project, we place significant emphasis on the [testing phase](/services/website-creation/web-development-website-testing/), checking page load speeds, appearance and functionality across a wide range of browsers, operating systems and devices. Older versions of these were included in our tests so we could be confident that the site looks good and works properly on the vast majority of devices currently in use.
