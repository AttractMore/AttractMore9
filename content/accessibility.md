We want our website to be useable by as many people as possible, irrespective of any disability they may be experiencing, temporarily or permanently. We have built this website to be accessible with common assistive technologies and different ways of using websites. This means that you can:

- Navigate the menus and all interactive functionality without a mouse as well as using assistive technology such as a screen reader.
- Increase the font size or zoom in on content (using browser functions)
- Use the high-contrast focus indicator (blue box) included to help sighted keyboard users to navigate through pages.
- Navigate a page using headings. We also aim to use plain English to make our content clear and easy to understand.
- Navigate our websites with assistive technology via embedded landmarks and ARIA functionality.

## Guidance

[AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk) provide a free resource to help you customise your PC or Mac, tablet or phone to make it easier to use. All these devices have accessibility tools built in - it's just a question of knowing how to use them.

## Problems and suggestions

Despite our efforts, there may remain some parts of the website that are not so easy to access and, if you find anything amiss, please do [contact us](/contact/) and we will do our best to remedy it. Your assistance will help all website users.
